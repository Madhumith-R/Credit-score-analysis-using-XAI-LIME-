Many industries and Organizations are using artificial intelligence and machine learning models to make informed decisions. However, as these technologies continue to advance and become more complex, humans are challenged to understand and retrace the decision-making process of those AI solutions. Such a challenge can be tackled using explainable AI (XAI for short).

Explainable AI refers to a set of processes and methods that aim to provide a clear and human-understandable explanation for the decisions generated by AI and machine learning models.

Integrating an explainability layer into these models, Data Scientists and Machine Learning practitioners can create more trustworthy and transparent systems to assist a wide range of stakeholders such as developers, regulators, and end-users.

Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME for short). Instead of providing a global understanding of the model on the entire dataset, LIME focuses on explaining the modelâ€™s prediction for individual instances.
